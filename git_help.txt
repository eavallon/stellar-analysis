1)   set up git repository from local computer
from terminal:

>>> git clone 'https://github.com/tdwilkinson/stellar-analysis.git'

2)   make sure local files are up-to-date with online files

>>> git pull

3)   after making edits to local file, add it to files to be pushed, add commit
     comments, and push to online files

>>> git add stellar_analysis.py
>>> git commit -m 'added some stuffs'

This should update what is online!
Last thing is for:
Tessa to keep her fork up to date with Ellis' by sending pull requests and
Ellis to keep her version updated by accepting the pull requests.
